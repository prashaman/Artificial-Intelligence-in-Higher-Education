Highlights

This manuscript makes a significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence by introducing the Human-Driven AI in Higher Education (HD-AIHED) framework, which ensures that AI in higher education is aligned with ethical principles, institutional objectives, and human oversight. This research is important because it offers a structured governance model that addresses key challenges in AI adoption, such as bias, transparency, and accountability. The manuscript provides an innovative approach that balances technological advancements with ethical considerations, ensuring that AI serves as an enabler rather than a disruptor in higher education.

Key Reasons Why This Contribution Is Important
1. Introduction of a Human-Driven AI Governance Model
The HD-AIHED framework is a novel contribution to AI governance in higher education. It ensures that AI applications in teaching, administration, and student support are monitored, regulated, and aligned with institutional values. This framework moves beyond traditional AI adoption models, which focus primarily on efficiency, and instead prioritizes fairness, inclusivity, and human accountability.
Section 2.4 – Conceptualization of the Framework explains the structural elements of HD-AIHED and how it integrates human decision-making into AI-driven processes.
Section 5.2 – Phased Human Intelligence Across the AI Lifecycle describes how the framework ensures ethical compliance at each stage of AI deployment.
2. Addressing AI Duality: Opportunities vs. Challenges
The manuscript highlights the dual nature of AI in higher education. While AI offers benefits such as personalized learning, predictive analytics, and administrative efficiency, it also introduces ethical risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns, and over-reliance on automation. The study provides a balanced analysis, demonstrating the need for ethical AI governance to mitigate risks while leveraging AI’s potential.
Section 3.4 – Duality in AIHED: Successes and Setbacks discusses the contrasting effects of AI on student learning, faculty decision-making, and institutional policies.
Section 3.6 – Global Ethical Challenges and Barriers explains how AI governance frameworks can reduce ethical risks while maximizing benefits.
3. Mitigating AI Bias and Ensuring Fairness
One of the most pressing issues in AI adoption is bias in decision-making algorithms. The HD-AIHED framework proposes structured auditing mechanisms, transparent AI governance policies, and participatory decision-making to address these concerns. The study emphasizes that AI should not replace human judgment in critical areas such as admissions, grading, and hiring but should act as a supportive tool.
Section 6.1 – Significance and Strengths of HD-AIHED details the importance of fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI decision-making.
Section 3.6.1 – Basic Ethical Instincts: Privacy, Bias, and Fairness outlines strategies for identifying and eliminating algorithmic bias in AI-driven processes.
4. Regionally Adaptable AI Implementation
Unlike generic AI governance models, the HD-AIHED framework recognizes regional disparities in AI adoption. The study proposes adaptable AI policies that account for differences in technological infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and institutional capacities. By addressing these variations, the framework ensures AI governance remains scalable and context-sensitive.
Section 3.4.5 – Global Dynamics of AIHED Adoption examines how AI implementation varies across different educational institutions and regulatory environments.
Section 6.2 – HD-AIHED Model in Action presents case studies that demonstrate the adaptability of AI governance strategies.
5. Policy and Institutional Recommendations for AI in Higher Education
The author provides policy-level recommendations to help higher education institutions implement AI governance structures that are ethical, transparent, and effective. These recommendations include:
Establishing AI Ethics Committees within universities.
Aligning AI policies with global regulatory standards such as UNESCO AI Ethics and GDPR.
Promoting AI literacy among educators and students to ensure responsible AI use.
Section 6 – Key Insights from the HD-AIHED Model presents a structured roadmap for AI governance implementation.
Section 8 – Conclusion and Final Recommendations provides institutional, policy, and regulatory recommendations to ensure AI adoption remains ethical and student-centered.

Conclusion: Why This Contribution Matters to AI Research
This research is crucial for AI governance in education because it:
•	Bridges the gap between AI innovation and ethical concerns.
•	Introduces a governance model that ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability.
•	Provides structured policy recommendations for institutions to implement AI ethically.
•	Ensures AI serves as a support system rather than a decision-making authority in critical educational processes.
The HD-AIHED framework fills a critical gap in AI research by offering a structured, ethically grounded, and human-driven approach to AI governance in higher education. The manuscript not only highlights AI’s transformative potential but also provides practical solutions to its challenges, ensuring AI adoption aligns with ethical and institutional objectives.

Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming higher education (HE) by enabling personalized learning, automating administrative processes, and enhancing decision-making. However, AI adoption presents significant ethical and institutional challenges, including algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns, and governance inconsistencies. This study introduces the Human-Driven AI in Higher Education (HD-AIHED) Framework, an adaptive and structured model designed to integrate human intelligence (HI) into every phase of the AI lifecycle—adoption, design, deployment, evaluation, and exploration. Unlike conventional AI models that prioritize automation, HD-AIHED emphasizes human-centered governance, ethical compliance, and participatory decision-making to ensure that AI enhances rather than replaces human agency in HE.
The framework aligns AI applications with both institutional and student needs, fostering trust, adaptability, and transparency. Its dual-layered approach integrates AI across both the AI lifecycle and the student lifecycle, ensuring context-sensitive, equitable, and goal-oriented AI implementation. A key contribution of this study is its regionally adaptable approach, recognizing variations in technological infrastructure and policy landscapes. Additionally, the integration of SWOC (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges) analysis during the adoption phase allows HE institutions to evaluate AI readiness, mitigate risks, and refine governance structures, while the exploration phase ensures long-term adaptability, scalability, sustainability, and AI promotion through continuous research, innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
To ensure AI remains a responsible enabler in HE, this study advocates for the establishment of University/HE Institutional AI Ethical Review Boards, alignment with global regulatory frameworks (e.g., UNESCO AI Ethics Guidelines, GDPR, Sustainable Development Goal 4), and the promotion of inclusive and transparent AI adoption policies.
Key insights from the HD-AIHED model highlight its role in bridging AI research gaps and overcoming real-time challenges in global HE institutions. The framework offers tailored strategies for diverse educational contexts, including developed and emerging countries, ensuring that AI implementation is contextually relevant and ethically sound. By emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration among policymakers, educators, industry leaders, and students, this study envisions AI as an ethical and equitable force for innovation in HE.
Ultimately, the HD-AIHED model serves as a catalyst for AI inclusivity rather than exclusion and a driver of educational equity rather than disparity by embedding the ethos of AIHED into higher education systems. Future research should focus on the empirical validation of HD-AIHED through institutional case studies, AI bias audits, and longitudinal assessments to ensure ethical integrity, transparency, and sustainability in AI deployment.
